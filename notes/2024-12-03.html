Do you think this information will help you approach learning more effectively? why or why not? How, if at all, does it changes how you think about debugging and learning to program? Give examples of how you have encountered the different types of confusion in your prior programming experiences. (to help you get good strategies and prime for things we will see in the next few weeks)</span>
<span class="go">_practice/2024-09-10.md:3. map out your computing knowledge and add it to your kwl chart repo in a file called {index}`prior-knowledge-map.md`. Use [mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) syntax, to draw your map. GitHub can render it for you including while you work using the preview button. (what we will learn will connect a lot of ideas, mapping out where you start, sets you up for success)</span>
<span class="go">_practice/2024-09-12.md:3. Try using setting up git using your favorite IDE or GitHub Desktop. Make a file {index}`gitoffline.md` and include some notes of how it went. Was it hard? easy? what did you figure out or get stuck on? Is the terminology consistent or does it use different terms?</span>
<span class="go">_practice/2024-09-12.md:2. **lab** Explore the difference between git add and git commit: try committing and pushing without adding, then add and push without committing. Describe what happens in each case in a file called {index}`gitcommit_tips.md`. Compare what happens based on what you can see on GitHub and what you can see with git status. Write a scenario with examples of how a person might make mistakes with git add and commit and what to look for to get unstuck. </span>
<span class="go">_practice/2024-09-17.md:1. Create a merge conflict in your KWL repo on the branch for this issue and resolve it using your favorite IDE, then create one and resolve it on GitHub in browser (this requires the merge conflict to occur on a PR). Describe how you created it, show the files, and describe how your IDE helps or does not help in {index}`merge_conflict_comparison.md`. Give advice for when you think someone should resolve a merge conflict in GitHub vs using an IDE. (if you do not regulary use an, IDE, try VSCode) *You can put content in the file for this step for the purpose of making the merge conflicts for this exercise.* </span>
<span class="go">_practice/2024-09-17.md:3. In {index}`branches-forks.md` in your KWL repo, compare and contrast branches and forks; be specific about their relationship.

<span class="go">_practice/2024-09-19.md:2. Get set up so that you can contribute to the course website repo from your local system. Note: you can pull from the `compsys-progtools/fall2024` repo, but you do not not have push permission, so there is more to do than clone.  Append the commands used and the contents of your `fll2024/.git/config`to a {index}`git-remote-practice.md`. Then, using a text editor (or IDE), wrap each log with three backticks to make them [fenced code blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks) and add headings to the sections. </span>

Tip: Start with a file explorer open, but then try to close it, and use only command line tools to explore and make your choices. If you get stuck, look up additional commands to do acomplish your goals.  </span>
<span class="go">_practice/2024-09-26.md:1. Most real projects partly adhere and at least partly deviate from any major design philosophy or paradigm. Add a `## Unix Philosophy` section to your {index}`software.md` about how that project adheres to and deviates from the unix philosophy. Be specific, using links to specific lines of code or specific sections in the documentation that support your claims. Provide at least one example of both adhering and deviating from the philosophy and three total examples (that is 2 examples for one side and one for the other).  You can see what badge `software.md` was previously assigned in and the original instructions [on the KWL file list](https://compsys-progtools.github.io/spring2024/genindex.html).</span>
<span class="go">_practice/2024-10-01.md:1. Explore the [tools for conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/about/#tooling-for-conventional-commits) and then pick one to try out. Work on the branch for this badge and use one of the tools that helps making conventional commits (eg in VSCode or a CLI for it)for a series of commits adding &quot;features&quot; and &quot;bug fixes&quot; telling the story of a code project in a file called {index}`commit-story.md`.  For each edit, add short phrases like &#39;new feature 1&#39;, or &#39;next bug fix&#39; to the single file each time, but use conventional commits for each commit. In total make at least 5 different types of changes (types per conventional commits standard) including 2 breaking changes and at least 10 total commits to the file. </span>

Using a text editor, wrap each log with three backticks to make them &quot;code blocks&quot;  and then add text to the file describing a use case where that format in particular would be helpful. **do this after the above so that your git log examples include your conventional commits**</span>
<span class="go">_practice/2024-10-08.md:1. Read about different workflows in git and add responses to the below in a {index}`workflows.md` in your kwl repo. Two good places to read from are [Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Distributed-Workflows#ch05-distributed-git) and the [atlassian Docs](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows)</span>
<span class="go">_practice/2024-10-08.md:3. Add the hash of the content of your completed {index}`workflows.md` file and put that in the comment of your badge PR for this badge. *Try to do this from your local CLI, but full credit even if you use the website interface*</span>

Describe the number system and its usage in {index}`numbers.md`. Include links to your sources and be sure that the sources are trustworthy. </span>
<span class="go">_practice/2024-10-10.md:5. Calculate the maximum number of git objects that a repo can have without requiring you to use more than the minimum number of characters to refer to any object and include that number in  {index}`gitcounts_scenarios.md`  with a title `# Git counts`. Describe 3 scenarios that would get you to that number of objects in terms of what types of objects would exist. For example, what is the maximum number of commits you could have without exceeding that number? How could you get to that number of objects in the fewest number of commits? What might be a typical way to get there? Assume normal git use with porcelain commands, not atypical cases with plubming commands. *If you get stuck, outline what you know and then request a review.* </span>
<span class="go">_practice/2024-10-10.md:7. Learn more about how git is working on changing from SHA-1 to SHA-256 and answer the transition questions below {index}`gittransition.md`</span>

Make a file {index}`gitplumbingdetail.md` and create a a table or mermaid diagram that shows the relationship between at least **three** porcelain commands and their corresponding plumbing commands (generally more than one each). </span>
<span class="go">_practice/2024-10-17.md:2. Create {index}`gitislike.md` and explain main git operations we have seen (add, commit, push) in your own words in a way that will either help you remember or how you would explain it to someone else at a high level. This might be analogies or explanations using other programming concepts or concepts from a hobby.</span>
<span class="go">_practice/2024-10-24.md:1. Answer the following in {index}`hpc.md` of your KWL repo:  (to think about how the design of the system we used in class impacts programming and connect it to other ideas taught in CS)</span>
