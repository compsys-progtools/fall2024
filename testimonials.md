# Testimonials From Fall 2024 Students
***

The best way to succeed in this class is to review the notes, this class covers many different topics and is very dense in its material. It is important to nail down the fundamentals
ASAP and maybe even watch videos ahead of lecture once you see the topic in order to stay on top. The notes are your best friend in this class and help to reinforce material, don't just read them either-
see if you are able to apply what you have learned and go off on your own and try things. This is a class where the things that you learn will be things that you carry with you for the rest of your professional
career, so don't look at it as simply looking for a grade, look at it as a class for skill building. Another piece of advice that I have is to stay on top of your work, I know numerous people who have
left work for the end of the semester because there are not harsh deadlines, this is not a good setup and you will not be able to retain the information right, and in some cases you won't be able to get the 
grade that you want either.
