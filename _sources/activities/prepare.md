# Prepare for the next class




These tasks are usually not based on material that we have already seen in class.  Mostly they are to have you start thinking about the topic that we are *about* to cover before we do so. Often this will include reviewing related concepts that you should have learned in a previous course (like pointers from 211) Getting whatever you know about the topic fresh in your mind in advance of class helps your brain get ready to learn the new material more easily; brains learn by making connections.

Other times prepare tasks are to have you install things so that you can engage in the class.  

The correct answer is not as important for these activities as it is to do them **before class**.  We will build on these ideas in class. These are evaluated on completion only[^cmplt], but we may ask you questions or leave comments if appropriate, in that event you should reply and then we will approve. 


[^cmplt]: you will get full credit as long as all of the things are *done in good faith* even if not correct. However if it looks like you tried to outsource (eg to LLM) or plagiarize a solution, you will not earn credit for that.
