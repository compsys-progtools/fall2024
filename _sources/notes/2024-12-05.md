# Speaker

We had a speaker [Krystal Folkes Brown](https://www.linkedin.com/in/krystalfolkes/)


```{tip}
For a community badge, you can contribute to a summary of the conversation here. There will be an open PR that removes this tip that you can add to as a "PR review".

You can also contribute relevant glossary terms from the conversation on that same branch.
